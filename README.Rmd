# Air Quality Analysis

This R script analyzes air quality data, calculates average solar radiation for each month, and explores the correlation between ozone and solar radiation.

## Installation

Make sure you have the following R packages installed:

- ggplot2

You can install them using `install.packages("ggplot2")`.

## Usage

1. Run the script in R.

2. The script will clean the data, calculate averages, correlations, generate plots, and save the results.

## Functions

### `clean_data(data)`

Cleans the input data by removing rows with missing values.

### `calculate_avg_solar(data, month)`

Calculates the average solar radiation for a specific month.

- `data`: The input data frame.
- `month`: The month for which to calculate the average.

### `calculate_correlation(data, month)`

Calculates the correlation between ozone and solar radiation for a specific month.

- `data`: The input data frame.
- `month`: The month for which to calculate the correlation.

### `generate_and_save_plot(data, month, title, filename)`

Generates a scatter plot of ozone vs. solar radiation and saves it to a file.

- `data`: The input data frame.
- `month`: The month for which to generate the plot.
- `title`: The title of the plot.
- `filename`: The name of the output file.
